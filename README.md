This project analyzes and visualizes student academic participation by leveraging data on demographics, enrollment, and attendance.

The dataset includes the following key fields:
* Student ID
* Name
* Gender
* Course Name
* Enrollment Date
* Attendance

The objective is to derive meaningful insights by calculating essential metrics such as retention rate, average attendance, enrollment trends, and course satisfaction rate. These insights will help enhance student engagement and improve academic outcomes.

## Data Cleaning:
1. Addressed missing values by filling blanks and removing incomplete records in key fields such as Age, Gender, Attendance Percentage, Retention Rate, and Satisfaction Score.

2. Approxamately 500 duplicate entries had been removed resulting total number of Students to 10,000 for final data Analysis. 

2. Validated date formats for enrollment dates and ensured logical consistency in attendance values.

3. Standardized column names and ensured consistency in formatting for improved data integrity.
